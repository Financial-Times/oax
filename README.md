_scrumple was helpful when we needed to build bower components, but those days are now behind us._

# Scrumple

A fast (and scrappy) JavaScript bundler for developing Origami components.

## Why?

### Fast! :crab:

During development we want compilation to be as fast as possible.

### Origami specific

Scrumple is based on a now-deleted tool called Pax, but we have added support for `bower_components` and optimised the code for Origami components. For example, it uses the `browser` field by default when building an npm component.

### Scrappy

This is a developer tool, not production software. It's designed to give the developer super-fast feedback when building components, not for building a production application.

## Installation

Scrumple is available to install via npm:

```
npm install -g scrumple
```

## Usage

```
Usage: scrumple [options] <input> [output]
       scrumple [-h | --help | -v | --version]

Options:
    -i, --input <input>
        Use <input> as the main module.

    -o, --output <output>
        Write bundle to <output> and source map to <output>.map.
        Default: '-' for stdout.

    -m, --map <map>
        Output source map to <map>.

    -I, --map-inline
        Output source map inline as data: URI.

    -M, --no-map
        Suppress source map output when it would normally be implied.

    -w, --watch
        Watch for changes to <input> and its dependencies.

    -W, --quiet-watch
        Don't emit a bell character for errors that occur while watching.
        Implies --watch.

    -x, --external <module1,module2,...>
        Don't resolve or include modules named <module1>, <module2>, etc.;
        leave them as require('<module>') references in the bundle. Specifying
        a path instead of a module name does nothing.

    --external-core
        Ignore references to node.js core modules like 'events' and leave them
        as require('<module>') references in the bundle.

    -b, --for-bower
        Use bower.json instead of package.json

    -N, --allow-npm-dev-deps
        When using --for-bower, this forces packages in the project's
        package.json#devDependencies to be resolved through npm. This is is for
        creating testing bundles that use npm-only dependencies

    -h, --help
        Print this message.

    -v, --version
        Print version information.
```

## Development

Scrumple is written in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) :crab:

### Updating snapshots

Scrumple makes use of [insta](https://docs.rs/insta/0.16.0/insta/) for snapshots.

If you have changed some code and `cargo test` is failing, you can check the new snapshot is correct (which is available at `src/test/$snapshot_name.snap.new`) and then replace the old one.

Insta provides a tool which gives you a lovely interface for doing this, instead of doing it manually. It's called `cargo-insta`.

```
cargo install cargo-insta
cargo test
cargo insta review
```

This will bring up a menu that lets you review and confirm the snapshots in your terminal.
